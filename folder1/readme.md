## Project Title
**HR Analytics Dashboard ‚Äì Full Insights using Power BI**

---

## Brief One-Line Summary
A dynamic HR dashboard that enables data-driven decision-making by visualizing employee metrics like promotion, retrenchment, satisfaction, and performance.

---

## Overview
This Power BI dashboard aggregates and visualizes HR-related KPIs to help HR managers understand workforce dynamics and make strategic decisions. It includes gender ratios, promotion readiness, retrenchment alerts, job satisfaction distribution, service years, and more across departments and job roles.

## Problem Statement
Many HR departments struggle with identifying trends in workforce retention, job satisfaction, or promotion-readiness due to scattered data and static reporting tools. This dashboard centralizes and visualizes these KPIs for immediate insights, improved efficiency, and proactive decision-making.

## Navigation
The dashboard includes three navigable pages for a smooth user experience:
- **Home Page**: Summary stats for gender, promotions, retrenchment, and KPIs.
- **Action Page**: Drill-down by department, job role, and job satisfaction level.
- **Detail Page**: Deep insights on service years, retrenchment risk, office distance, job levels, and more.

Navigation buttons on the left allow seamless transitions between the pages.
