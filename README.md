## 🧾 Project Title
**U.S. City-Wise Energy Consumption Dashboard (2023–2024)**

---

## 🪄 Brief One-Line Summary
A Power BI-based data visualization project showcasing multi-city energy consumption trends, enabling better decision-making through interactive and comparative analytics.

---

## 📌 Overview
This project visualizes and compares energy consumption across three major U.S. cities—**Chicago**, **New York**, and **Atlanta**—from January 2023 to December 2024.  
It provides **real-time insights** into consumption behavior, seasonal trends, cost fluctuations, and operational efficiency across multiple locations.

---

## ❗ Problem Statement
With increasing urban energy demand, decision-makers often lack clear insights into how energy consumption varies by city and season.  
This project aims to bridge that gap using **interactive dashboards** that allow for real-time trend analysis and performance benchmarking.

---

## 📂 Dataset
**Source Format:** CSV files  
**Coverage Period:** January 2023 – December 2024  
**Cities Included:** Chicago, New York, Atlanta  

### **Data Columns**
- Date  
- Location  
- Monthly Energy Consumption (kWh)  
- Peak Demand  
- Unit Cost  
- Total Cost  

---

## 🛠 Tools and Technologies
- **Power BI Desktop** – for dashboard development  
- **Microsoft Excel** – for data preparation  
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** – for measures and KPIs  
- **CSV Files** – as input datasets  

---

## 📈 Methods
- Data cleaning and transformation using **Power Query**  
- Time-series and trend analysis (monthly and yearly)  
- Comparative visualizations across locations  
- DAX measures for:
  - Total and average energy consumption  
  - Cost and peak demand tracking  
  - City-level aggregation and comparison  

---

## 🔍 Key Insights
- **Chicago** shows the highest seasonal fluctuations in energy consumption.  
- **New York** maintains a steady pattern with moderate variation.  
- **Atlanta** exhibits increased energy demand during summer months.  
- **Unit cost** plays a critical role in driving total consumption expenses.  

---

## 📊 Dashboard / Model / Output
The Power BI dashboard includes:
- KPI Tiles for **total consumption**, **cost**, and **peak load**  
- Slicers for **city** and **date range** selection  
- **Line Chart**: Monthly energy consumption trends  
- **Bar Chart**: Monthly cost comparison by city  
- **Heat Map**: Peak demand distribution
