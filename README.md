## 📌 Overview
This project analyzes monthly energy consumption data from three cities—Chicago, New York, and Atlanta—between January 2023 and December 2024. It aims to provide real-time and comparative insights into energy patterns, seasonal variation, peak loads, and efficiency opportunities.

---

## ❗ Problem Statement
Energy consumption is one of the most critical metrics for operational performance and cost control in urban infrastructures. However, energy trends and anomalies can be hard to interpret without visual context. This project solves that gap using interactive dashboards for better monitoring and decision-making.

---

## 📂 Dataset
- Format: `.csv`
- Period Covered: January 2023 – December 2024
- Data Points:
  - Location (Chicago, New York, Atlanta)
  - Monthly Energy Consumption (kWh)
  - Peak Demand
  - Unit Cost
  - Total Cost
  - Date

---

## 🛠 Tools and Technologies
- Power BI Desktop
- Microsoft Excel
- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)
- CSV for data import

---

## 📈 Methods
- Data Cleaning using Power Query
- Time-series analysis and filtering (Monthly / Yearly)
- Comparative bar and line charts by location
- DAX formulas to calculate:
  - Monthly energy consumption
  - Cost savings
  - Peak load averages

---

## 🔍 Key Insights
- Chicago exhibits the highest seasonal variation.
- New York maintains relatively steady energy consumption throughout the year.
- Atlanta shows higher peak demand in summer months.
- Unit cost fluctuations contribute significantly to total energy expenditure.

---

## 📊 Dashboard / Output
- KPI Tiles: Energy Consumption, Cost, and Peak Load
- Slicers: Date Range, City
- Line Chart: Energy Consumption over Time
- Bar Chart: Comparative Monthly Cost by Location
- Heat Map: Peak Demand Distribution

---

## ▶ How to Run this Project?
1. Open `ENERGY DASHBOARD.pbix` in Power BI Desktop.
2. Load CSV files (January 2023 to December 2024) if not already embedded.
3. Refresh the data model.
4. Use the slicers and visual filters to explore city-wise and time-wise insights.

---

## ✅ Results & Conclusion
This dashboard demonstrates how visual analytics can simplify energy management. Stakeholders can now:
- Identify periods of high energy usage
- Make cost-saving decisions
- Compare cities across seasons
- Track KPIs with interactive controls

## 📌 Project Overview
This project visualizes monthly energy usage across three major U.S. cities. The goal is to enable comparative analysis, identify consumption peaks, and aid better energy planning through historical insights.

---

## ❓ Problem Statement
With rising urban energy demands, it’s essential to understand usage trends and forecast needs. This dashboard empowers stakeholders to:
- Compare city-wise energy consumption
- Analyze seasonal peaks
- Assess yearly usage variations

---

## 📦 Dataset
The project uses two CSV files containing energy consumption data:
- `April_2023.csv`
- `April_2024.csv`
Data ranges from **January 2023 to December 2024** for:
- Chicago
- New York
- Atlanta

---

## 🛠️ Tools and Technologies
- **Power BI Desktop**
- Microsoft Excel (for preprocessing)
- CSV files as data sources

---

## 📈 Methods
- Data transformation in Power Query
- Time-based aggregation (monthly/yearly)
- City-wise filtering with slicers
- KPI visualizations
- Line and bar charts for trend analysis

---

## 💡 Key Insights
- New York consistently shows higher consumption in winter months.
- Chicago displays more stable patterns with minor summer peaks.
- Atlanta's consumption spikes in warmer months.
- Year-on-year usage trends can inform infrastructure investment decisions.

---

## 📊 Dashboard Overview
The dashboard contains:
- KPI cards for total and peak usage
- Monthly trend line graphs
- Bar charts comparing cities
- Interactive filters by city and date
