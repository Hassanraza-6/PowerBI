## 📌 Overview
This project analyzes monthly energy consumption data from three cities—Chicago, New York, and Atlanta—between January 2023 and December 2024. It aims to provide real-time and comparative insights into energy patterns, seasonal variation, peak loads, and efficiency opportunities.

---

## ❗ Problem Statement
Energy consumption is one of the most critical metrics for operational performance and cost control in urban infrastructures. However, energy trends and anomalies can be hard to interpret without visual context. This project solves that gap using interactive dashboards for better monitoring and decision-making.

## 📂 Dataset
- Format: `.csv`
- Period Covered: January 2023 – December 2024
- Data Points:
  - Location (Chicago, New York, Atlanta)
  - Monthly Energy Consumption (kWh)
  - Peak Demand
  - Unit Cost
  - Total Cost
  - Date

---

## 🛠 Tools and Technologies
- Power BI Desktop
- Microsoft Excel
- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)
- CSV for data import

---

## 📈 Methods
- Data Cleaning using Power Query
- Time-series analysis and filtering (Monthly / Yearly)
- Comparative bar and line charts by location
- DAX formulas to calculate:
  - Monthly energy consumption
  - Cost savings
  - Peak load averages

---

## 🔍 Key Insights
- Chicago exhibits the highest seasonal variation.
- New York maintains relatively steady energy consumption throughout the year.
- Atlanta shows higher peak demand in summer months.
- Unit cost fluctuations contribute significantly to total energy expenditure.

---

## 📊 Dashboard / Output
- KPI Tiles: Energy Consumption, Cost, and Peak Load
- Slicers: Date Range, City
- Line Chart: Energy Consumption over Time
- Bar Chart: Comparative Monthly Cost by Location
- Heat Map: Peak Demand Distribution

## ▶ How to Run this Project?
1. Open `ENERGY DASHBOARD.pbix` in Power BI Desktop.
2. Load CSV files (January 2023 to December 2024) if not already embedded.
3. Refresh the data model.
4. Use the slicers and visual filters to explore city-wise and time-wise insights.

## ✅ Results & Conclusion
This dashboard demonstrates how visual analytics can simplify energy management. Stakeholders can now:
- Identify periods of high energy usage
- Make cost-saving decisions
- Compare cities across seasons
- Track KPIs with interactive controls
