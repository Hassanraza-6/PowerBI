## 📌 Project Overview
This project visualizes monthly energy usage across three major U.S. cities. The goal is to enable comparative analysis, identify consumption peaks, and aid better energy planning through historical insights.

---

## ❓ Problem Statement
With rising urban energy demands, it’s essential to understand usage trends and forecast needs. This dashboard empowers stakeholders to:
- Compare city-wise energy consumption
- Analyze seasonal peaks
- Assess yearly usage variations

---

## 📦 Dataset
The project uses two CSV files containing energy consumption data:
- `April_2023.csv`
- `April_2024.csv`
Data ranges from **January 2023 to December 2024** for:
- Chicago
- New York
- Atlanta

---

## 🛠️ Tools and Technologies
- **Power BI Desktop**
- Microsoft Excel (for preprocessing)
- CSV files as data sources

---

## 📈 Methods
- Data transformation in Power Query
- Time-based aggregation (monthly/yearly)
- City-wise filtering with slicers
- KPI visualizations
- Line and bar charts for trend analysis

---

## 💡 Key Insights
- New York consistently shows higher consumption in winter months.
- Chicago displays more stable patterns with minor summer peaks.
- Atlanta's consumption spikes in warmer months.
- Year-on-year usage trends can inform infrastructure investment decisions.

---

## 📊 Dashboard Overview
The dashboard contains:
