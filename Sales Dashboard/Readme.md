## 🏷 Project Title

**Super Store Sales Dashboard in Power BI**

---

## ✍️ Brief One-Line Summary

A real-time retail sales dashboard analyzing regional performance, profit trends, product category metrics, and customer segments.

## 📌 Overview

The dashboard provides insights into a superstore's sales and profit metrics using historical data. It offers drill-down capability by year, region, category, and sub-category while tracking performance KPIs such as orders, profit, and shipping duration.
